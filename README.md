# Research and development at Hyper

We at [Hyper](https://www.hyper.no) are actively doing research in different
areas of information technology. It's in our DNA to be curious about new trends
and developments, as it's the only way to survive in a fast-changing industry.

Every day we are testing new tools, building our own
[open source projects](https://github.com/hyperoslo) and taking an active role
in developer communities. This is an amazing feeling to be inspired and being a
source of inspiration. But at the same time it's not easy neither to learn how
to search through all the "data smog" of information nor to filter, sort and
keep in memory most interesting, relevant and engaging findings.

It's important to be one step ahead of the heard, never stop learning,
exploring and experimenting. And it's equally important to keep a balance
between jumping on a brand new technology and being stuck with existing, time
proven and working solutions. That's why we're starting **Hyper Radar**
project.

**This repo aims to be:**

- A well structured knowledge base with intuitive navigation through topics,
articles and discussions.
- A source of inspiration and a driver of innovation.
- A designated place for writing down bright ideas and suggestions.
- A place to share, discuss and review trending tech topics and new promising
tools.

**Everyone is welcome to participate:**

- [Start](https://github.com/hyperoslo/hyper-radar/issues/new)
a discussion if you have something on your mind.
- Choose an appropriate category and write a review (summary) if you want to
put some light on any tech related topic.

## ðŸ“– Table of Contents

The project's structure will gradually change over time and is always open for
adjustments. The main goal is to make it easy and intuitive to navigate through
and find a relevant information.

## ðŸ”­ Lab

We all have our own areas of expertise and preferences, something we're best
at and can talk with excitement and enthusiasm for hours. And there is always
something we're missing because we're so used to seeing what we already know
and are comfortable with. The technology is not staying still, and from time to
time it's healthy to force ourself into those uncomfortable spheres where we
can start challenging our thinking.

We need to know where our focus should be. Unexpected customer requests are
inevitable and can't be foreseen, but what we can do is to be well prepared and
know the right answers. It's hard to know everything without becoming
a "Master of None", but it helps to have an overview of what is possible and
what is not, without digging too deep into implementation details.

We live to break down and solve complex tasks by creating practical,
maintainable and scalable solutions. And this is the reason we love great
development tools. But the right tools should be built upon the actual needs,
not the other way around. There is no "silver bullet" that works in all the
cases, so itâ€™s important to remember that the main goal is to find out the most
elegant and efficient way for solving a given problem, at certain circumstances.

Share your experience to help in our community to stay sober and make the
right decision when it comes to choosing a new library or programming
language everyone around is talking about. Try to ask yourself the following
questions when you write a summary:

- What all the fuzz is about?
- What is it for?
- How mature the tool is?
- How could it be applied to real-world problems?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages comparing to existing solutions?
- How relevant is it for us and our customers?

## ðŸŽ¤ Stage

internet: popular tech-related stories, articles and everything that can
inspire and push us forward.

## ðŸš€ Contributing

We would love you be involved in **Hyper Radar** evolution!
Come up with new ideas, play with new tech, participate in discussions and
don't be afraid to express your own views and opinions. Have you built
something cool? A library, side project or a homemade spacecraft? Go and share
it with the world!

- Create a pull request whenever you want to add new content and/or write a
summary of one or another topic.
- Choose the right category or create a new folder if it's something completely
new.
- Keep your summaries short and concrete. Remember that it's not an article,
but just a brief, a detailed outline of a subject.
- Examples are optional, but recommended.
- Don't repeat existing topics, but feel free to update them with relevant
details, comments and references.
- [Create an issue](https://github.com/hyperoslo/hyper-radar/issues/new) to
start discussions and create feature requests.
- Be sure to check our past issues before opening new ones.

**And let the party begin** ðŸŽ‰
